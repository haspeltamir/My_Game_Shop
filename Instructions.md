# Project Instructions
    ## Project Overview
    In this project, I have created a game shop using React. The game shop has a list of games that can be added to the cart. The cart shows the total amount of the games added to the cart. The user can also remove the games from the cart. The project is built using React and Redux(Maybe).

    i will use Chakra UI for styling the project.
